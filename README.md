# Onionspray

This role clones the [Onionspray][] repo and builds from source the necessary
software (OpenResty with the Nginx [http_substitutions_filter][] module,
[Onionbalance][], Tor).

[Onionspray]: https://onionservices.torproject.org/apps/web/onionspray/
[Onionbalance]: https://onionservices.torproject.org/apps/base/onionbalance/
[http_substitutions_filter]: https://github.com/yaoweibin/ngx_http_substitutions_filter_module

The role first generates the configuration files needed to serve a website. The
build is then done by the `opt/build-DISTRO.sh` script inside the Onionspray
repo, executed by this role, depending on the distribution of your server and
if supported.

## Requirements

The remote host should have `git` installed prior to running the role. The
other necessary packages are installed by the build process of Onionspray.

Your Ansible controller should use pipelining. In your `ansible.cfg`:

```
[connection]
pipelining=True
```

## Quick-start

Assuming you have a host named `myhost` on which you can run
`ansible-playbook`, and you cloned this role in a `roles` directory, this is an
example of a basic playbook:

```yaml
- name: Onionspray Tor proxy
  hosts: myhost
  roles:
    - onionspray
```

You can configure your project(s), i.e. the website(s) that Onionspray will
handle, using the `onionspray_project_settings` variable, a list of
dictionaries. You may also want to (re)define other values: check below for a
complete list of variables and their usage.

As an example, you could have in `host_vars/myhost.yml`:

```yaml
onionspray_provider: 'myprovider'

## Certificate handling

This role uses [Onionspray][]'s self-signed HTTPS certificate generation script
by default. The script parameters can be customized as documented in the variables
section.

Additionally, custom HTTPS keys and certificates can be provided, either by:

1. Declaring then as encrypted role variables.
2. Uploading then directly in the Onionspray instance with an external script.

In Tor, all requests are encrypted by the protocol. The URL itself is the
guarentee that you are connecting to the right server. It is hence not strictly
necessary to generate a valid HTTPS certificate, [more info
here](https://community.torproject.org/onion-services/advanced/https/).

However, it is still better to use a valid HTTPS certificate, to avoid HTTPS
warnings on browsers such as Brave for example. The Tor Browser does not
display HTTPS warnings if using a self-signed certificate with an Onion
service, though this may change in the future.

Should you want to get a valid HTTPS certificate, both [HARICA][harica-onion]
(normal certificate, $10/year) and [Digicert][digicert-onion] (expensive, EV
certificate) provide them. Let's Encrypt and other providers using the ACME
protocol (i.e. automation possible through `certbot` for example) still do not
support these certificates. Using these valid certificates is hence a manual
operation, as long as [ACME for Onions][] is not implemented.

## Variables

This role can be customized in many ways through variables, which are described
in lenght at the [defaults file](defaults/main.yml).

## Contributing

All contributions are very welcome. Feel free to send your enhancements and
patches as PRs, or open issues.

## Development

This role has [molecule tests](molecule):

* The `podman` scenario is a generic one and is well suited for testing both
  locally and through CI.
* The `local` scenario actually applies the configuration into the running
  node, so be careful were to run it.

A [Makefile](Makefile) exists to help local testing, which relies on
[AnCIble][] to be available somewhere. Details in how to use it are given
[here][].
