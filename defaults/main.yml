onionspray_repository_version: HEAD

# The system platform to build Onionspray for.
#
# This is used to determine which dependency resolution and installation
# scripts to use.
#
# By default, this role tries to use the distribution and release names,

# Certificate handling
#

# The path of a file containing one or more certificate authorities (CAs), that
# will be used by Onionspray to validate the TLS certificates of the proxied
# domains.
#
# By default, contains the path of the CA file managed by the Debian
# `ca-certificates` package (`/etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt`).
#
# The role will abort if this file does not exist.
#
# If you wish to skip this verification (not recommended, as you expose your
# Onionspray host to Machine-In-The-Middle attacks if you do so), you can
# redefine the `onionspray_check_cert_with_ca_file` variable.
onionspray_ca_file: /etc/ssl/certs/ca-certificates.crt

# A list of dictionaries, each dictionary representing a project (i.e. a
# clearnet website that Onionspray will proxy).
#
# The supported fields per dictionary are listed below.
#
# ### `onionspray_project_settings`

# website that Onionspray will proxy). The supported fields per dictionary are
# listed below.
#
# #### `project_name`
#
# REQUIRED: the name of your Onionspray project, used to set the configuration
# and settings filenames.
#
# #### `hardmaps` and `softmaps`
#
# These two fields are used to define the hardmaps or softmaps used by
# Onionspray. You can find more information on these concepts in the [Onionspray
# documentation](https://onionservices.torproject.org/apps/web/onionspray/guides/balance/).
#
# They support the same fields.
#
# ##### `upstream_address`
#
# REQUIRED: the clearnet domain name to which Onionspray will proxy requests.
#
# ##### `onion_address`
#
# The custom `.onion` v3 address to use, dependent on the public/secret keys
# used. The corresponding public/secret keys, using the same `onion_address` value,
# should be defined in the `onionspray_keys` variable to use this field.
#
# If this field and the public/secret keys in the `onionspray_keys` variable are
# not defined, a new keypair will be generated. Keep in mind that if you modify
# the project configuration without defining this field, a new keypair will be
# generated in the next Ansible run, and so the `.onion` address used by
# Onionspray will change.
#
# ##### `public_key_base64`
#
# The Onion v3 public key to use, encoded in Base64.
#
# This field is not required, but defining it is necessary to persist a given
# `.onion` address.
#
# If unset, Onionspray will generate and use a random Onion Services key pair.
#
# The Base64-encoded key can be produced directly from a generate public key,
# with
#
#     cat hs_ed25519_public_key | base64
#
# ##### `secret_key_base64`
#
# The Onion v3 secret key to use, encoded in Base64.
#
# This field is only required if a public key is defined through `public_key_base64`.
#
# It's recommended that this variable to be also encrypted using [Ansible Vault][].
#
# [Ansible Vault]: https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/vault_guide/vault.html
#
# The Base64-encoded and then encrypted key can be produced directly from a
# generate public key, with
#
#     cat hs_ed25519_secret_key | base64 | ansible-vault encrypt_string
#
# #### `keys_upload`
#
# Setting this parameter to `true` makes Onionspray to upload the Onion Service
# keys using an external script.
#
# This variable is optional. If unset, Onionspray will generate and use a
# random Onion Services key pair.
#
# #### `foreignmaps`
#
# The `foreignmaps` variable is used to store onion-to-site mappings that exist
# outside of this particular configuration file, eg: for some other sites.
#
# Each entry should use the following fields.
#
# ##### `upstream_address`
#
# The clearnet domain name to which Onionspray will proxy requests.
#
# ##### `onion_address`
#
# The Onion Service address for the foreign map.
#
# ##### `tls_certificate`
#
# The PEM-encoded TLS certificate for the Onion Service.
#
# This variable is optional. If unset, Onionspray will generate and use a
# self-signed certificate.
#
# #### `tls_secret_key`
#
# The PEM-encoded and then Ansible Vault-encrypted secret key for the Onion
# Service.
#
# Required only if `tls_certificate` is used.
#
# #### `certificate_upload`
#
# Setting this parameter to `true` makes Onionspray to upload the TLS keys
# and certificates using an external script.
#
# This variable is optional. If unset, Onionspray will generate and use a
# self-signed certificate.
